What began as simple viruses designed to disrupt computer systems has transformed into a sophisticated array of threats capable of infiltrating networks, stealing data, and even holding entire organizations hostage.

            'Malware comes in various forms, each with its own method of operation and objective. Among the most common types are viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware, and adware. Viruses attach themselves to legitimate programs or files and replicate when activated, while worms spread independently across networks. Trojans masquerade as legitimate software to deceive users into executing malicious actions. Ransomware encrypts files or locks systems, demanding payment for their release, while spyware and adware stealthily gather user information or display unwanted advertisements. Understanding the diversity of malware is crucial for implementing effective defense mechanisms.',
